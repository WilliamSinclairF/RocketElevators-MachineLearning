# RocketElevators-MachineLearning
Contains all the code for the week 13 for Machine Learning

### Week 13 overview

This week we had to create a Machine learning API using the Azure Api **Speech**. We used our voice to simulate a conversation that happen inside an elevator and see how well it can detect our voice and if it was able to translate it to text. From the **Speech** Service offered by Azure we have used *Speech-to-Text* and *Speaker Recognition*.


#
### Exemple of how the  *Speech Api* actually work:

> **Pros:** The **Speech-To-Text** worked really well and the transcription doesnt differ a lot from the true result.


> **Cons:** The **Speech API** from  **Azure** as some flaws where it wont recognize enrolled voice from conversation.

### Languages used 

> Ruby *(For Website page)*

> JavaScript *(For the Machine Learning)*
