# Machine Learning
Contains all the code for the week 13 for Machine Learning

### Week 13 overview

This week we had to create a Machine learning API using the Azure Api **Speech**. We used our voice to simulate a conversation that happen inside an elevator and see how well it can detect our voice and if it was able to translate it to text. From the **Speech** Service offered by Azure we have used *Speech-to-Text* and *Speaker Recognition*.

<hr />

### Exemple of how the  *Speech Api* actually work:

![](images/mermaidGraph.png)
First we create a *.wav* sound in this specific specs :
|# Rate                         |Format         |Channel  |
|-------------------------------|---------------|---------|
|`16000Hz`                        |`16-bit`       |`1(Mono)`|

We then enroll the *.wav* sound and extract them for modeling and then send to the database. Once enrolled we can use an other sample and let the **API** compare the 2 sounds together and then give a results based on the modeling from the first data we gave. The 2 major result are `Accepted (score > 0.5)` and `Rejected (score < 0.5)`.

> **Pros:** The **Speech-To-Text** worked really well and the transcription doesnt differ a lot from the true result.
> 
> **Cons:** The **Speech API** from  **Azure** as some flaws where it wont recognize enrolled voice from conversation.

### Testing Zone
You can find find the pages of this week by login to the website with: `Email: admin@admin.com` and `Password: admin123`.

> Put the audio file on your local drive to test the *speaker transcribe*.

`Enroll` : The *enrole* section is use to create your voice profile inside the Database.
`Upload` : The *Upload* section is use to test this audio clip against a voice profile.
`Verify` : With the *verify* section you can test your Newly enroll profil ( or an older one) against and audio clip and verify if your test match !

Choose your language ex: *English* and your input ex: *Microphone*
With the Speech Recognition we give you 3 choices to recognize:

- *1 phrase*
- *Continuous*
- *Translator*

Once your parameter selected you click on **Start** and see the magic !
